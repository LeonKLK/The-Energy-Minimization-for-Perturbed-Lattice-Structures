# Introduction

This is a computational physics projects in The Chinese University of Hong Kong(CUHK). In this project we focused on lattice structures with different energy potentials using C, including Aluminium and Magnesium Oxide, both of them are ace-centered cubic structure.

If you have another substances or other structures, remember to
