# Introduction

This is a computational physics projects in The Chinese University of Hong Kong(CUHK). In this project we focused on lattice structures with different energy potentials using C, including Aluminium and Magnesium Oxide, both of them are face-centered cubic structure.

If you have another substances with other structures, remember to reconstruct the struture first, also the paremater for different potentials.
